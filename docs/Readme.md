Text Analysis API

A small FastAPI project that exposes text analysis utilities through a REST API.
It takes plain text (or a .txt file) and returns useful statistics such as word counts, hapax legomena, sentence length, and lexical diversity.

Project Structure:

   backend/
   ├─ api/                # FastAPI app
   │   └─ main.py
   ├─ app/                # Core utilities
   │   ├─ io_utils.py
   │   └─ text_utils.py
   └─ tests/              # Pytest unit tests

Features:

Upload a text file and receive structured JSON analysis.

Metrics include:

Most frequent words (top_n)

Hapax legomena (words that appear only once)

Sentence count

Average sentence length

Lexical diversity

Unique words and total tokens

Interactive documentation with Swagger UI and ReDoc (auto-generated by FastAPI).


1 create virtual environment with:

   python -m venv .venv

and:

   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1       for Windows PowerShell
   source .venv/Scripts/activate    for Windows Bash
   source .venv/bin/activate        for Linux, MacOS

2 Install dependencies

   pip install -r requirements.txt

3 From the backend/ directory:

   fastapi dev api/main.py

Tests:

   You can run unit tests with:

      pytest

Notes:

Built with FastAPI, pydantic, and pandas.

Intended as a learning project for experimenting with backend development and text processing.

Clean and modular: logic is in app/, API layer is in api/.
